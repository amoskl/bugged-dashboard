## ✨ Features

- **Smart Task Filtering**: Filter tasks by status (All, Pending, Completed, Due Today)
- **Real-time UI Updates**: Mark tasks complete with immediate visual feedback
- **Responsive Design**: Works beautifully on desktop and mobile devices
- **Priority Management**: Visual priority indicators (High, Medium, Low)
- **Date Formatting**: Smart date display (Today, Tomorrow, or full date)
- **Interactive Elements**: Hover effects and smooth transitions

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

This project originally contained 3 intentional bugs that have been **completely resolved**:

### ✅ Bug 1: Due Today Filter Fixed

- **Issue**: "Due Today" filter wasn't working - showed no results even when tasks were due today
- **Root Cause**: Filter compared `task.dueDate` with string `'today'` instead of actual date
- **Solution**: Updated filter logic to use `getTodayString()` function for proper date comparison
- **Result**: Filter now correctly shows tasks due today

### ✅ Bug 2: Mark Complete UI Updates Fixed

- **Issue**: Clicking "Mark Complete" updated backend but UI remained unchanged
- **Root Cause**: `setTasks` function call was commented out in `markComplete` function
- **Solution**: Uncommented the state update logic
- **Result**: UI now updates immediately when tasks are marked complete/incomplete

### ✅ Bug 3: Hover Error Eliminated

- **Issue**: Hovering over tasks caused JavaScript errors in console
- **Root Cause**: Code tried to access `task.category.name` but `category` property doesn't exist
- **Solution**: Updated hover handler to safely access existing properties (`title`, `priority`)
- **Result**: Clean hover functionality with no console errors

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **Build Tool**: Vite 6.x for fast development and optimized builds
- **Styling**: CSS3 with modern features and responsive design
- **State Management**: React hooks (`useState`) for local state
- **Development**: Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for instant updates
